### Objectives

In this lab, I developed a MIPS assembly program that counts the cold, hot and comfort days in a period of time, with respect to temperature.

### Code

The source code is shown below with comments and explanation on the back of each role.

```assembly
.data 
    Array: .word 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37

Notes: In large projects we should also store the values of a0-a3 into memory, but in this project, it happened that the a* registers are enough, hence I think we can save the trouble to sw and then lw, like the following code, for convenience and ease to read.

```assembly
	addi $sp, $sp, -8
	sw $a0, 0($sp)
	sw $a1, 4($sp)
	add $a0, $0, $t1 #suppose t1 is the value we need
	...
	lw $a0, 0($sp)
	lw $a1, 4($sp)
	...
```

### Process and expectation

The usage of registers are shown below:

t0~t9: For temp use, instead of storing.

s0: hotDay

s1: coldDay

s2: comfortDay

s3: cnt

s4: i (A[i], starts from numElements - 1 )

s5: constant -1

s6: constant 1 (note: I should use t-registers to do the job, but it turned out that there are enough registers and hence using s-registers saves much lines)

a0: address of A[0]

a1: numElements

a2: mode (i.e. hotDay, coldDay, comfortDay)

a3: A[i] that needs to be passed into hot, cold, comfort

v0: returned values



Expectation:

Since the array I set is 1-37, increasing 1 at a time, we should have 5 (1-5) coldDay (<=5), 24 (6-29) comfortDay (>5 && <30) and 8 (30-37) hotDays (>=30).

### Results

I stored the values of hotDay in s0, coldDay in s1, and comfortDay in s2, the results are shown below

I also printed the results out, hence we also get

Where hotDay = 8, coldDay = 5, comfortDay = 24, just as we expected.
